      <h2>Wife lied about murder confession: counsel</h2>
      Date:2011-09-15 Author:AAP
      <div id="more"><p>A Vietnamese woman was lying when she said her American husband confessed to 
murdering Sydney nurse manager Michelle Beets, a jury has been told.</p>
<p>Keith Chapple, SC, representing former US marine Walter Ciaran Marsh, told 
the NSW Supreme Court jury on Thursday the defence would take issue with the 
evidence of Samantha Marsh and her brother.</p>
<p>Describing them as key witnesses in the Crown case against Marsh, Mr Chapple 
said they "delayed and delayed and delayed" getting their versions to 
police.</p>
<p>"We submit they delayed and delayed because they were making things up and 
we're seeing how things were developing and when police were pursuing Mr Marsh - 
wrongly - they saw an opportunity," he said.</p>
<p>Marsh, 50, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Ms Betts, 57, on April 27 last 
year on the verandah of her Chatswood home.</p>
<p>The Crown allege Marsh slit her throat and stabbed her eight times in the 
chest after she gave him bad job references when his nursing contract wasn't 
renewed at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital.</p>
<p>In the defence opening, Mr Chapple said Mrs Marsh claimed her husband 
confessed to the murder about an hour after Ms Bates was stabbed.</p>
<p>"In fact, weeks went by before she told the police what we submit to you is a 
story that the accused had confessed," he said.</p>
<p>During this time, she maintained her normal life, went to work and she and 
her brother stayed living with Marsh.</p>
<p>"You will hear evidence about a conversation that she had with police 
officers on the evening when she told them what we submit to you is untrue and 
is a story she made up," Mr Chapple said.</p>
<p>"She was told that she would be given assistance to stay in the country by 
virtue of a visa protection and that she also had money paid to her, for example 
towards accommodation."</p>
<p>Many of the issues she and her brother would give evidence about would be 
disputed, including a claim Marsh demonstrated on them an ability to attack 
somebody with a knife.</p>
<p>The defence would also refute the Crown claim that Marsh had been trained to 
use knives while in the US Marine Corps, adding that there would be no evidence 
from anyone that "they saw him or instructed him" using knives.</p>
<p>Mr Chapple said the Crown also alleged Marsh carried some animosity towards 
Ms Beets, but he said the evidence seemed to suggest exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>The defence also took issue about any evidence from Mrs Marsh suggesting that 
her husband had expressed such animosity or had planned the murder and had 
undertaken surveillance of Ms Beets' home.</p>
<p>"The defence case is he was not there, he was not the perpetrator of this 
crime," he said.</p>The trial is continuing before Justice Derek Price.
